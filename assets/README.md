# Coding Class

## Learning my PC

-My motivation was experiencing coding through my partner and friends around through their work and school work.
- I built this project because I was really excited to gain some knowledge about what I was going to learn in my course work before my actual classes started.
- The knowledge I gained through my prework helps me sort through web pages and recipes while i'm working at my cooking job.
- I learned how to sort information, make a webpage, HTML, CSS, Javascript and how they work.

## Usage

Personally, what I learned in the prework could be used for sorting out catalogs or sorting information while I'm at work. I could use it to help out friends and family with projects and work issues.
